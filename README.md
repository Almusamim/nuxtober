# Nuxtober

First change to your theme directory

```
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/bskimball/nuxtober.git myTheme

# cd into theme
$ cd myTheme

# install depencies
npm install

# generate static pages
npm generate
```

You can just add pages in myTheme/src/pages then run npm run generate and it will output files into myTheme pages.

The trick is the october module in myTheme/src/modules that converts the generated html to htm files.

Documentation for Nuxt is here https://nuxtjs.org
